## Asking for help, a quick guide.

### Format

The proper and encouraged format in my honest opinion is:

```
Error from the Output or what happens when it runs.

What you want to achieve.

Any other info -- Optional

Input the code snippet here that causes the error.
```

This way of formatting is not required however it is heavily encouraged and can help people to be able to help you faster and more efficiently.

### Formatting your Code
Formatting your code is a simple way to be able to clean up your call for help.

Of course it is different for every platform however I'm gonna be talking about the most commonly used one, Markdown.

Formatting code in Markdown is simple, simply add 3 ` at the start and the end and put your code inside that.

```
local Variable = 2

print(Variable)
```

### Tips for asking for help

- Don't ask to ask, just ask
  - I've seen so many people on Discord and other platforms ask to ask.
  - This is heavily discouraged since it wastes time, and You're putting a responsibility on the person who responded yes to your question to ask.
  - For more info I advise you to go to [DontAskToAsk](https://dontasktoask.com/)

- Don't say hello
  - I've seen so many users on Discord and other platforms say
  
  ```
    - Hello! Can you help me with my problem?
    - Yeah.
    - The problem is, ... blah blah blah
  ```
  
  This is inefficient and time wasting, since when a person responds they'll have to wait for you to type out your problem.

  - Instead, you can do this:
  
  ```
    - Hello! I'm currently facing this problem in which .. blah blah blah
    - You can do .. blah blah blah
  ```
  
  - This is much more efficient and better than then the last example.
  - For more information visit [NoHello](https://nohello.net/)

- Don't ask for full systems or scripts.
  - Please for all that is good, DO NOT ask for full systems or scripts.
  - This will both harm the person who helps and the person who asks.
    - It'll harm the person who helps as they'll waste their time and effort to get (most of the time) no reward.
    - It'll harm the person who asks as they will learn absolutely nothing.
